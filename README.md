##Loan Prediction Project 


#Situation Analysis: 

In finance, Machine Learning algorithms are used to detect fraud. 
Machine Learnin algorithms could then easily predict the customers who are at risk for defaulting on their loans to help companies rethink or adjust terms for each customer.

#Data Source:  Kaggle, the home of Data Science

#Objective of Machine Learning Model

The goal for this project is to predict which of the customers will have their loan paid or not. 
Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem to be trained with algorithms like:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
